                <h2>Microcontroller Programming</h2>
                <p>
                    As a student who is experienced in working on robotic projects, I have the ability to
                    write programming language using C/C++ language. A microcontroller project I'm working on
                    are Arduino, ATmega, NodeMCU. The projects I've worked on are working on volcanic robots
                    in the development of gui systems and sending data using Arduino Mega 250, making and
                    developing IOT balancing robots using Arduino Mini and ESP8266, and many more.</p>

                <h2>App Developer</h2>
                <p>
                    In developing a desktop application, I have experience in C# and Java programming languages.
                    Some of the projects I've worked on are designing and developing a volcanic robot gui
                    using C#-based visual studio, designing and developing a bluetooth-based temperature
                    checker using Android studio which was developed with the Java language. And various
                    other projects that I have worked on.</p>

                <h2>PLC HMI Programming</h2>
                <p>
                    To work on automation systems in the industrial sector, we need a controller as the
                    control center of a system and a display that makes it easy for the user to set the
                    required parameters. Therefore I have experience in programming a PLC
                    (Programmable Logic Controller) and HMI (Human Machine Interface) as the main
                    control system for automation. Some of the projects I worked on were making a
                    control system for working on an N2 generator system using Omron and an HMI
                    display using Weintek, making an FO purifier system using Fatek PLC,
                    and several other projects.

                    you can see. I am still developing my ability to process the web using PHP
                    and a database in a system that I will develop into an IoT-based electronic
                    control system.

                <h1>Boiler Project System</h1>
                <p>
                    In this boiler project, I am working on a sequence analysis program from
                    Boiler. Analysis of the sequence of programs needed to make it easier to
                    troubleshoot the boiler system. I coordinate with the electrician to
                    determine the action to be taken and analyze the damage to the system.
                    In this project, the system can't burn automatically. After analyzing
                    the PLC program, there is a malfunction in the light sensor to detect
                    combustion in the boiler.</p>

                    so that there is no damage to the system. There are several parameters
                    in preventing the engine from being damaged, such as oil pressure, oil
                    temperature, amount of fuel, RPM of the motor, and so on. These
                    parameters are controlled by a PLC and report to the user what to do to
                    prevent the machine from being damaged.</p>

                <p>This is a project in robotics lectures with two other friends.
                    This robot works via a wifi connection by utilizing esp8266. I work
                    in the robot's electrical system and also make connections to local
                    wifi networks. The results of this project can be seen that the
                    robot can run in a balanced manner using a PID control system programmed
                    through an arduino controller.

                    developed this GUI using C#, openGL and C/C++. The data obtained by this GUI will not be
